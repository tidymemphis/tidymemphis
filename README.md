Memphis COVID-19 resource list

This is intended to be an open-source list of resources available for Memphians during the COVID-19 outbreak. Feel free to add however you think will help.

Some first things that need to be done:

 - Clean up the bits of the blog that are left. I'll try to do this. But I am VERY new to programming and would like someone to hold my hand through this.
 - Create a list of what is needed right now. Information on the disease, testing sites, information on what to expect, and making sure people know what is available at any point in this process.
 - And how do we allow people to change information?
