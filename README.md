# Memphis COVID-19 Resource. 

For and by Memphians

First I want to address data handling: everyone has access and full control of their own data. No data will EVER be sold. The more we work together and are open with each other, the better our chances are. 

Planned sitemap

## Information on the Virus

- What is it?
- Why are we quarantining?
- How has it affected other places?
	- Link to Johns Hopkins global map: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
	- Testing data for each state available here: https://covidtracking.com/data/
- What can we expect?
	- Links to stories from other countries
- Q/A for specific questions
 - Ex: Can I go on walks? (Yes)

## Memphis Economic Impacts

- interactive map of all closings? Otherwise a list for
	- Restaurant closings
	- Store closings
	- School closings etc
- Displaced workers/tip jar
	- Is there a way for people to donate to one restaurant and have the donation be dispersed among employees?
- There is suddenly a lot of need for delivery. Is there a way we can help? Either with restaurants, or seniors that need groceries and prescriptions delivered.

## COVID-19 & Memphians
- How many Memphians have it?
	- current number of cases reported by the Shelby County Health Department
	- number of cases reported by TDoH
- Map of cases in each county in the surrounding area
	- Very important that we include Mississippi and Arkansas counties, not just Tennessee

	- Requirements to be tested
	- List or map of testing locations
	- Where are tests verified?
