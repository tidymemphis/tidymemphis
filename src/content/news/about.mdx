This site was originally formed to host the links for the [virtual tip jar](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMUxwOvTsmaAnxvTRW1h-X5iBe9ftCCpHi9ap3VfK9fSrmqw/viewform). As someone who has worked in the service industry for years (Boscos, Saltwater Crab, and DWJ Korean BBQ), I felt I had to do something to help my friends that were suddenly in job limbo.

I'm currently in graduate school for Urban Planning at the University of Memphis, and our department is all about bringing people together. I hope this website can be used as a tool to help Memphians communicate with each other and receive reliable information. [Send me an email](mailto:sarahviamemphis@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

This website is entirely open source! That means anyone can add to it. You currently have to have a github account, but we are working to make it so anyone in Memphis can easily add and share information. Thank you so much to [Ryan Filler](https://github.com/ryanfiller) for getting this website off the ground.
