This site was originally formed by Sarah Johnson to host the links for the [virtual tip jar](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMUxwOvTsmaAnxvTRW1h-X5iBe9ftCCpHi9ap3VfK9fSrmqw/viewform). As someone who has worked in the service industry for years (Boscos, Saltwater Crab, and DWJ Korean BBQ), I felt I had to do something to help my friends that were suddenly in job limbo.

Send Sarah [an email](mailto:sarahviamemphis@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

This website is entirely open source! That means anyone can add to it. You currently have to have a github account, but we are working to make it so anyone in Memphis can easily add and share information. Thank you so much to [Ryan Filler](https://github.com/ryanfiller) for help getting this website off the ground.
