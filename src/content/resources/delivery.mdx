If you don't feel comfortable leaving your house, get help from recently displaced workers. Call **901-504-4749** or fill out the form on their website to ask for assistance. They offer to shop, pick up groceries, cook, make drinks, unclog toilets, fix doorknobs, move stuff, or anything else you need.
