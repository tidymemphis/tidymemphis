## [Indie Memphis Movie Club](https://www.indiememphis.org/movie-club) üé¨

Since you can't go to the theater, Indie Memphis is starting a movie club! The Movie Club hosts virtual screenings (for new films and classics), and online Q&As with special guests on Tuesday evenings. Rent movies online, $12 for a 5 day rental, and half of the revenue is shared with Indie Memphis. If you're not already, [become a member](https://www.indiememphis.org/members-patrons) of Indie Memphis or send a [one-time donation](https://www.indiememphis.org/donate).
