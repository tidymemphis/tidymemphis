## What is price gouging?

In emergencies, some supplies that are normally cheap become very valuable (like toilet paper). Price gouging is when the price of a good is unnecessarily raised during a emergency to take advantage of increased demand. Price gouging is illegal in Tennessee.

## How do I report price gouging?

Go to the TN Department of Commerce & Insurance's [CORE website](https://core.tn.gov/datamart/login.do). Click *[File a Complaint](https://core.tn.gov/datamart/complaintLoginTNDCI.do)* in the upper right hand corner. You can either create an account, or continue as a guest.

On the *Type of Complaint* page, open the *Board* dropdown and select *Consumer Affairs*. Open the License Type dropdown and select *Consumer Affairs Complaints*.

On the next page enter the required information about the business that was price gouging. The next page requires you to enter information about yourself.

On the *Complaint Details* page, open the Category dropdown and select *Price Gouging*. Complete the remainder of the forms, then submit the report.
