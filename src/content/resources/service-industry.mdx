## [How to File a Mass Layoff](https://www.tn.gov/workforce/covid-19/employers.html) üö£

Employers have two ways to speed up the funemployment process for employees. If you do not file one of the two options, you have to respond to each individual claim, delaying the benefit payment process.

1. If your business has already closed and you are not in contact with your employees, fill out this [mass layoff form](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/workforce/documents/MassLayoffTemplate.xlsx). Columns A through N must be filled in, and don't use any punctuation. Send the .xlsx file as an attachment to [mass.layoff@tn.gov](mailto:Mass.Layoff@tn.gov).

2. If your business has not yet closed and you believe you will reopen, fill out the [Employer-Filed Mass Claim form](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/workforce/documents/PartialTemplate.xlsx). If you're not sure when you'll reopen, enter 16 weeks from now. **Tell employees not to file individual claims. They will still have to check in every Sunday to keep receiving benefits.** Send the .xlsx file as an attachment to [Partial.Claims@tn.gov](mailto:Partial.Claims@tn.gov)

Tell your employees to expect an email to register at [jobs4tn.gov](https://www.jobs4tn.gov/). They will have to check in every week to tell the state that they're still not working.

## [File for Funemployment](https://www.jobs4tn.gov/) üìÑ
Click above to go to the Tennessee Department of Labor's website, click <b>Unemployment Benefits</b>, then <b>File a Claim</b> to see if you are eligible for unemployment benefits. You are able to file immediately after you lose your job. *You have to check in online every Sunday.*
