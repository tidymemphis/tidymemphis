#### Who Should Get Tested?

Due to the limited number of tests, cotton swabs, and protective masks for healthcare workers, the Shelby County Health Department is asking that only those showing symptoms should get tested. Everyone else should isolate at home.

#### What are the symptoms?

Fever, dry cough, difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, and possibly [loss of sense of smell and taste](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html). Symptoms can appear between any time between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus.

#### What should I do if I have symptoms?

Stay at home and away from other people in your home. Call your healthcare provider, and they will tell you if you need to get tested or not, and where you should go.

If you do not have a healthcare provider, call the Shelby County Health Department COVID-19 Call Center at **833-943-1658**. They take calls 8AM-4:30PM, Monday through Sunday. After hours, leave a message and they will return your call the next business day.

#### Does the test cost money?

Nope!

#### What is the test like?

The person conducting the test will stick a cotton swab up your nose till it feels like it's touching your brain. They're actually trying to collect some of your mucus membrane.

#### Where do I get tested?

**Every place that offers testing requires you to call ahead.**
